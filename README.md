# 315Project
Spam and ham sorter for text messages

Introduction

	For my 315 project, I’ve chosen to study the SMS spam collection dataset. In doing so, I would learn more about how spam is detected and filtered in texts and email, such as what information they parse through in order to determine if the sending user is a bot. I will try to discover what keywords or phrases might be found consistently throughout the data, and perhaps if features such as links or caller-id would be factored into that. Personally, I am curious on how accurately our modern spam detection systems work so well, I have only had a “ham” mail ever filtered for spam only once or twice. 

Dataset

	The source of my data is coming from the UCI machine learning repository, which I accessed from kaggle. 

Methodology

	Along with further research into phrase detecting algorithms, I will be looking into using some text scanning algorithm that searches for common strings and phrases. This works the best as the data contained in the dataset is a starting statement (spam or ham), therefore allowing me to attach that data to the text for other similar texts. 

Final Product

The outcome we are looking for is an algorithm accurately able to predict when spam is sent and detect it. Theoretically, my algorithm should be able to spam from randomly generated spam messages, and the more specific we can get with features analyzed the better our algorithm will be. I hope I can learn how user-created texts can be analyzed for spam mail and even more applications, such as spam accounts for other forms of media.
